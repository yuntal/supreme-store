Supreme E-commerce Store

Description:

In this project, my purpose is to demonstrate a simple e-commerce website where customers can browse and interact with products. The website features a product list that can be added to the shopping bag. Customers can select multiple quantities of the same item. Upon checkout, a cart page displays the list of added products along with the subtotal. The page offers a "Keep Shopping" button to continue shopping and a "Checkout" button pre-filled with dummy data.
