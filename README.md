Supreme e-commerce store


Description

In this project, my purpose is to demonstrate a simple e-commerce website, where the customer can look and interact with the products. There is a list of products you can add to your bag. You can also chose to add multiple of the same item, and at the end there is a cart page where you can see a list of the products that you've added, and the subtotal. There is a keep shopping button, that will keep the items in the array, and a checkout button that's filled with dummy data in this case.
